    "# Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of methods for building recommendation engines. I want to apply approaches for boardgames which is a personal hobby.\n",
    "\n",
    "The website \"https://boardgamegeek.com/\" has over 10000 ranked boardgames (includes expansions and variations of the same base boardgame). For new boardgame collectors and hobbyists, the number of choices is quite astronomical. Even if we reduce look at just the games released in the 2017, there are over 3000 boardgames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the primary problem is to identify patterns to help recommend boardgames to people who are looking to grow their boardgame collection.  "

    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach I chose was inspired by a basic Natural Language Processing technique: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW). In CBOW (and its brother the Skip-gram), words are essentially defined by its surrounding words. In the case of CBOW, we can be given a set of words (as in a sentence) and predict what word is most likely surrounded by that set of words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In that way, I thought it would be interesting to build a boardgame recommender based off which boardgame is most likely to appear with any set of boardgames. This would be quite different from defining boardgames by their defined features (Categories, Mechanics, player count, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are limitations to this approach (assuming the model can be built): Because it is reliant on existing collections, new boardgames released each year would automatically be ignored by the model (since no one would own them and they appear on very few collections at a time). The CBOW approach would probably work best for a new hobbyist who is interested in building a collection of games that have been around for a while (and can be found in many collections)."
